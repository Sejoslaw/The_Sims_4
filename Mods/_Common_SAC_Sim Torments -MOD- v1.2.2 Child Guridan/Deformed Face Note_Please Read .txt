The deformed face torment might rarely show up on some newly generated sims randomly, to fix that sim simply change or unequip their hat in CAS.
If you don't desire to use the deformed face torment. you can delete the "Deformed Face HAT" from the CAS folder that comes with the mod.
Thank you and enjoy â™¥
